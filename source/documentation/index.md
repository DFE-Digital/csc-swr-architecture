This is the Technical Documentation supporting the Alpha phase of the Children Social Care Social Worker Recording Service.

It utilises the [Tech Docs Template] in the [GitHub Tech Docs Code].

The Service Team have decided to use the [C4 Model] to visualise the architecture for the service.

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described in this [ADR Blog Post] are also used to record key decisions.
