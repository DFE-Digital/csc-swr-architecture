# Context

These context diagrams present a visualisation of the big picture.

## System Landscape Diagram

The System Landscape Diagram presents a 10,000ft view showing how software systems across the DfE and Local Authority enterprise bounds relate.

### As-Is System Landscape

The as-is system landscape represents the current landscape prior to DfE intervention.

* Children's Social Care users (Social Workers, Team Managers) interact with LA systems and services.

### To-Be System Landscape

The to-be system landscape represents the target landscape showing the perspective change following DfE interventions.

* Children's Social Care users interact through the DfE Social Worker Recording service acting as a Facade shielding the user from Dfe and Local Authority systems and services.

## System Context

The System Context Diagram is the highest level of abstraction.
It represents something that delivers value to its users (people, roles or personas) or adjecent external systems.

The following system contexts apply

* Department for Education (DfE)
* Local Authorities (LA)

### Department for Education System Context Diagram

The Social Worker Recording System Context presents a view of the SWR software system
showing the system landscape within the bounds of the SWR context
highlighting the users and adjacent systems that it interacts with.

The principal focus here is on the people (actors, role, personas...) and software systems.
It does not intend to show technologies, protocols or other low level details here.

#### Users

* Children's Social Care
  * Social Worker
  * Team Manager
* Care Child

#### External systems

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud
* Gov.UK

### Local Authority System Context Diagram

The Local Authority System Context presents a view of the Local Authority software systems
showing the system landscape within the bounds of the Local Authority context
highlighting the users and adjacent systems that it interacts with.

![LA System Context](images/LASystemContext.png)

As with the DfE system context, the principal focus here is on the people (actors, role, personas...) and software systems.
Similarly, it does not intend to show technologies, protocols or other low level details here.
